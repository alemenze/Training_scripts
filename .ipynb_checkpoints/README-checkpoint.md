# Training Folder
A collection of all the training documentation for the Molecular and Genomics Informatics Core. 

### Notebooks
This directory is a collection of Jupyter notebooks for follow along learning experiences. 
You will need to install the various packages associated with the particular notebook to be able to execute properly. Ill try to maintain the requirements.txt as best as possible, but I may miss some. This would be a great excuse to practice those install skills though!

### Presentations. 
This directory is a collection of powerpoint presentations as lectures. For the most part these will be image driven, and Ill try to keep them with notes as best as possible for presenting these materials without me.
